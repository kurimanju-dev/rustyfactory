# WIP

This will be a Satisfactory helper application designed to cover every Ficsit engineer's needs. Notable planned features include:

- Interaction with an in-game API provided by a custom mod. This mod will allow the application to read data from the game and provide real-time updates to RustyFactory.

- Interactive factory planning and optimization tools to help engineers design and optimize their factories. Automatic alternative recipe suggestions based on available resources and production goals.

- Automatic download and configuration of blueprints.

- Automatic setup/management of dedicated servers, powered by Docker or Podman (where available).

- Native support for running on Linux, macOS, and Windows. Note for macOS users: Due to the lack of support for Satisfactory on macOS, RustyFactory will only work in standalone mode or will have to connect to the game mod API over the network.
