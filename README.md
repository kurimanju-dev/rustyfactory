# WIP

- RustyFactory is a helper application for Satisfactory, designed to meet the needs of every Ficsit engineer. Notable planned features include:

- In-game API integration via a custom mod, allowing the application to read data from the game and provide real-time updates to RustyFactory.

- Interactive factory planning and optimization tools to assist engineers in designing and optimizing their factories. Includes automatic alternative recipe suggestions based on available resources and production goals.

- Automatic blueprint download and configuration.

- Automatic setup and management of dedicated servers, powered by Docker or Podman (where available).

- Native support for Linux, macOS, and Windows.
_Note for macOS users_: Due to the lack of official support for Satisfactory on macOS, RustyFactory can only run in standalone mode or connect to the game remotely. To use game integration features, Satisfactory must be running on a supported platform (Windows or Linux) with the API mod installed, and RustyFactory must connect to it over the network.
